# Elevator Simulation

## Project Overview

This project is an Elevator Simulation that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask to create a web-based interactive simulation of an elevator system. The simulation aims to demonstrate how an elevator operates in a building with multiple floors, handling requests from users to move between floors.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Users can click buttons to request the elevator from any floor to any other floor.
- **Real-time Elevator Movement**: The elevator moves between floors in real-time, displaying its current position.
- **Flask Backend**: The backend is powered by Flask, handling the simulation logic and serving the web pages.
- **Dynamic Floor Requests**: Users can request the elevator from multiple floors simultaneously, with the elevator queueing requests efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the interactive elements and real-time updates.
- **Flask**: For the backend server and handling the simulation logic.
